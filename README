======

This project has been adapted to our needs to include a better graphical interface along with auto ts file creation.
The system has been tested with a USRP N210 Radio and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 2.7.

In order to run the system, you need the following dependencies that you can install with :

sudo apt install git
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt install gnuradio
sudo apt-get install doxygen
sudo apt install graphviz
sudo apt install swig
sudo apt install xterm
sudo apt install ffmpeg


To build and install, type these commands in terminal:

git clone https://github.com/Anisan12/dvbs2_tx
cd dvbs2_tx/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig


Before executing for the first time, make sure you delete this file : ~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/dvbs2.conf
Also create a folder named "videos" in your home directory ~/videos/ where you put the original The_Maker.mp4 video file

** In case you don't have the original The_Maker.mp4**
1. Delete the file ~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/dvbs2.conf
2. Run the script ~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/dvbs2_tx.py, it will generate an error
3. Modify the file ~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/dvbs2.conf, first line is the path to the video of your choice (preferably in the folder ~/videos/)

To execute the program, run:
~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/dvbs2_tx.py


Accepted symbol rate is 5 000 000. If you need to modify, use this tool: 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drmpeg/dtv-utils/master/dvbs2rate.c
gcc dvbs2rate.c -o dvbs2rate -lm
./dvbs2rate 5000000
(where you replace 5000000 with your desired symbole rate)

*Please note you should also modify the file ~/dvbs2_tx/PythonMod/dvbs2_tx.py to the corresponding symbol rate (search for symbol_rate)
*You should also modify the rates file to make the corresponding changes with this command:
./dvbs2rate 5000000 > ~/dvbs2_tx/pythonMod/rates.txt
(where you replace 5000000 with your desired symbole rate)
